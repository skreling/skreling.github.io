Sam (she/her) is a 3rd year PhD student at the University of Washington in the Prugh Lab studying urban coyote diet and genetics. All of her work uses non-invasive genetics, meaning she never has to disturb or even see her study species! Instead, she spends many hours out in the numerous parks within the Greater Seattle Area with her golden retriever, Sequoia, looking for coyote scat (poop!). While formerly advised by Dr. Laura Prugh, and informally co-advised by Dr. Robert Long of Woodland Park Zoo, Sam also works closely with the amazing Schell Lab at the University of California Berkeley.

As a side project, Sam also writes about urban evolution and how changing evolutionary constraints in urban regions may alter wildlife at a genomic level!

Prior to starting her Ph.D. at UW, Sam graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in Molecular Environmental Biology and a minor in Geospatial Information Technology and Science. She worked as a deer trapping technician in Northern California with the Brashares Lab, an environmental scientist for the National Guard based in Boise, Idaho, and a co-field manager for *Ekipa Fanihy* (Team Fruit Bat) in Madagascar under the guidance of Cara Brook (now the Brook Lab at the University of Chicago).
